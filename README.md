# Mitochondria_Test
Testing the idea that we all ended up with the same mitochondrial DNA by just chance over generations


Mothers pass their mitochondrial DNA to their offspring. This passage of DNA is unique in the fact that it does not combine with the fathers DNA and is only passed
through the mother. 

In the present day all humans have the same mitochondrial DNA and the theory goes that overtime this occured because of the mechanics of how it is passed.

I made a simple program to test the idea that over generations we'd eventually be left with one type of mitochondria and my program seemed to indicate that
that process was probably what happened. If I started with a 1000 people with different mitochondria after about 70 generations they all ended up witht the
same mitochondria.

This was just a little test of idea, it wasn't based off any real data or anything like that. Here's the video that gave me the idea to make the program:
